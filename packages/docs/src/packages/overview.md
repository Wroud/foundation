# Overview

The Wroud Foundation offers a suite of tools to help developers implement best practices and efficient patterns in JavaScript applications. Our tools focus on modularity, ease of use, and performance.

## Available Packages

- **@wroud/di**: A lightweight dependency injection library for JavaScript inspired by [.NET's DI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection) system. Written in TypeScript, it supports modern JavaScript features, including decorators, and provides robust dependency management capabilities.
- **@wroud/vite-plugin-asset-resolver**: A Vite plugin that resolves assets from source directories when your compiled files live elsewhere.

- **Other Packages**: More tools to come, each aimed at addressing specific challenges in JavaScript development.
