# Navigation

`@wroud/navigation` is a flexible, pattern-matching navigation system for JavaScript applications. It works in any framework and provides powerful pattern matching, browser integration and navigation state management.

## Key Features

- **Pattern-based Routing**: Define static routes, parameter segments (`/users/:id`) and wildcards (`/files/:path*`).
- **Framework Agnostic**: Compatible with any JavaScript framework or vanilla JS.
- **Type Safety**: Written in TypeScript with full inference for route parameters.
- **Navigation History**: Built-in history management.
- **Browser Integration**: Optional synchronization with the browser's URL.
- **Extensible**: Build custom navigation implementations for any environment.
- **Pure ESM**: Ships as an ES module for modern tooling.
