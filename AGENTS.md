How to test:
1. before running tests you should build sources:
    ```sh
    yarn build
    ```
2. to run tests use `yarn test run` command
3. after any modifications you need to build sources again before testing

Ignore files and folders presented in .gitignore

Always ensure that tests passed before finishing task
